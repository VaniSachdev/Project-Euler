# Project Euler
Oiler not Youler! 

## Description 

[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net) is a website that contains a series of increasingly challenging mathematical/computer programming problems. Euler is designed to test a developer's understanding of the fundamental principles of a programming language. 

My goal is to solve one question (maybe more, maybe less) per day to learn new concepts, strengthen old ones, and eventually, to develop a more â€œoptimized intuition."
